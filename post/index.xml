      <description>The project aims to build an MCQ generation model utilizing a custom summarizer model and a BERT summarizer model The model includes key word extraction process in order to map the most relevant sentences from the summary to frame the questions and the answer choices are created using the trivial process of keeping the right answer(key word) as one of the options and adding distractors to fill up the choices.</description>

      <description>The aim of the project was to visualize the relationships between Loan Delinquency against other attributes in the dataset and build a Logistic Regression Model to predict the Loan Delinquency by a given customer. Tidied and transformed the dataset Utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn to plot visualizations between various variables Combined census data with the original data to plot spatial visualizations using ‘sf’ library Deployed three classification models with XGboost, Random Forest and Gaussian Naïve Bayes for Model Evaluation The Gaussian Naive Bayes model gave the best accuracy (89.</description>
